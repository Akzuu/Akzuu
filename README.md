## Hello, you’ve reached Kseli. I’m sorry I missed your call.

I’m probably sipping a good cocktail with my phone on silent, or exploring an intriguing wreck where the only sound is the steady flow of bubbles from my lungs.

Or maybe I’m at work—who knows? Take a look at the pins; they’ll reveal what I enjoy doing. You can also find me on LinkedIn, but please, no pöhinä. Email? Try
